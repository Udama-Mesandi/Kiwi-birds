    <h1> KIWI Bird ((Apteryx mantelli)) </h1>
    <div class="para1">
        <p><span id="change-colour-red">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown,
                fuzzy, and found in the produce section</span> of your local supermarket. But the
            kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the
            size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird
            found only in New Zealand.</p>

                        <h3>HABITAT AND DIET</h3>
                        <p>The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend
                            to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees
                            found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up
                            into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi
                            makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy
                            forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows
                            within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest
                            burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at
                            the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the
                            female is ready to lay her eggs.

                        <h3>FAMILY LIFE</h3>
                        <p>Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other
                            and their chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do
                            fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she
                            is not in the mood for his company. If another kiwi
                            invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis
                            have been known to fight to the death, although this is
                            rare.</p><p>An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a
                            female may choose a new male if a more desirable one
                            wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or
                            fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one
                            around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested,
                            the female might wander off or try to scare him away.</p>

                            <p>Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests
                            might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug
                            by the male.The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs
                            are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color.
                            They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg
                            might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would
                            be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving
                            birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to
                            the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the
                            female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms)
                            rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6
                            kilograms).</p>
